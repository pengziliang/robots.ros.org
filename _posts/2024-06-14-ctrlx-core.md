introduction: The industrial control system uses modern 64-bit architecture with fast 4-core CPUs that can be flexibly assigned to control tasks for optimum efficiency. ctrlX CORE has a wide range of interfaces such as 1Gbit Ethernet, USB and a µSD card slot as well as remanent memory for secure data storage as standard. The Edge Controller's field communication is handled via EtherCAT as an automation bus and thus enables easy integration of EtherCAT peripherals. If servicing is required, quick and PC-free hardware replacement can be carried out with the help of a license dongle.
