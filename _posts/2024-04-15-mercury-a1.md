MercuryA1 is equipped with 7 Elephant Robotâ€™s new self-developed "Power Spring" series harmonic modules. The maximum output torque can reach 80Nm, the encoder resolution is 19bit, and the repetitive positioning accuracy is as high as 0.6 arc minutes. The ultra-lightweight carbon fiber shell futher reducing weight, and greatly improves
the strength and rigidity of the entire machine.The Mercury A1 adopts single master control and dual slave control methods. The main control adopts Cortext
A72 - 1.5GHz, equipped with a 2.0-inch IPS-LCD capacitive touch screen, and cooperates with the myPanel OS independently developed by Elephant Robot to achieve rapid deployment and application without programming.
For the first time, Mercury A1 integrates 3 major
software operation modes and more than 10 kinds of hardware accessories. At the same time, a Robotics Educational Kit is provided to assist in the learning of software and hardware knowledge in multiple
disciplines.
